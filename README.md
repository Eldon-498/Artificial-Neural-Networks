# Project Description
Due to the rise and need for intelligent systems in the last few decades,there,s demand for artificial intelligence familiarity and expertise, this project aim to simplify and offer a practical guide to the most promising and commonly used Convolution neural network variations for image processing and analysis.They include;Convolutional Networks, Deconvolution networks,Inverse Graphics Networks and Generative Sdverserail networks.
All these networks use the same fomular of convolution(convolving equations) but with different tuning and additional network layers.
Objectives were to meet the following:
Definitions of neural network terminologies  and the neural network layers
The mathematical formular in which they operate
Visual representation of the layers involved and how they coherently function to process images
Applications of the Neural Networks
# Tools Used:
Neural Network console
# Datasets Used:
MNIST handwritting dataset
