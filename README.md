# Project Description
Due to the rise and need for intelligent systems during the last few decades, this project aim to symplify and offer a practical guide to the most promosing and commonly used convolution networks variations and the include;Convolutional Networks, Deconvolution networks,Inverse Graphics Networks and Generative Sdverserail networks.
All these networks use the same fomular of convolution but with different tuning and additional network layers.
Objectives were to meet the following:
Definitions and the neural networks
The mathematical formular in which they operate
Visual represenattion of the layers invlolved and how they coherently function to process images
Applications of the Neural Networks
#Tools Used:
Neural Network console
# Datasets Used:
MNIST handwritting dataset
